Zeno Clash Multiplayer

== About ==

Name: Zeno Clash Multiplayer
Description: Basic multiplayer plugin for Zeno Clash. Currently it's very much a work in progress.
Requirements: Zeno Clash (buy it at http://store.steampowered.com/app/22200/).
Running: Copy the zcmp/ directory to steamapps/sourcemods

Currently the server browser can't find games - to connect to a server look in your friends list at someone playing then click "View Game Info" and note the IP Address.
In-game open the console and type connect followed by the contents of the IP Address field e.g. "connect 192.168.0.24:27015"
